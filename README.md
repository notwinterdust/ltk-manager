## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 10 or 11** (64-bit). macOS and Linux support is planned.
- **League of Legends** — a valid game installation.

### Installation

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/ltk-manager/releases/latest).
2. Download the `.msi` installer (recommended) or the NSIS `.exe` installer.
3. Run the installer and launch **LTK Manager**.
4. On first launch, the app will attempt to auto-detect your League of Legends installation. If it can't find it, you'll be prompted to select the game folder manually.

### Installing Mods

1. Download a mod in `.modpkg` or `.fantome` format from your preferred source.
2. Drag and drop the file onto the LTK Manager window, or use the install button.
3. Enable the mod in your library and click **Run** to start the patcher.

## ⚖️ License & Reuse

LTK Manager is open-source under a dual **MIT / Apache-2.0** license — you may choose either.

### `cslol-dll.dll` Policy

This application bundles `cslol-dll.dll`, the core injection module originally from cslol-manager. Its use and redistribution are governed by the [CSLOL DLL License Addendum](LICENSE-CSLOL.md).

If you are a developer looking to reuse this DLL in your own launcher or tool, you must comply with the following:

1. **Re-signing** — You may not redistribute the DLL with the official signature. You must re-sign it using your own publicly trusted code-signing certificate.
2. **Transparency** — You must publish your certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint and the DLL's SHA-256 hash in your project's documentation or about page.
3. **Anti-Skinhacking** — You must implement technical measures to prevent the use of "skinhacking" (replicating paid content) and competitive advantage mods.
4. **No Reverse Engineering** — Patching or tampering with the DLL itself is strictly prohibited.

For full terms, see [LICENSE-CSLOL.md](LICENSE-CSLOL.md).
